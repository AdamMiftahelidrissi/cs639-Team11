Proposal

The app will be an app for gym employees to clock in and clock out of their job. The employees will be given a time window to clock in and clock out, as well as take attendance in their workout classes (if they teach any).

This app is important because it will help employers and businesses accurately pay their employees. Many businesses still use in person clock in & clock out features and in this modern time, that makes it difficult for remote admin employees. The US economy loses 50 million hours of productivity per day due to unrecorded work. Employers overpay an average of 200 billable hours per year without time tracking.
Many gyms don't have any sort of attendance data for workout classes. This can be an obstacle for instructors who have people sign up for their class, and then not show up. If attendance is recorded, they would be able to ban someone from signing up after x amount of classes missed.
