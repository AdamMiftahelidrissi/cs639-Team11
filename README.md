Proposal
The app will be designed for employees to clock in and clock out of their job. It will specifically cater to educational workplaces where children are involved. Teachers will have a defined time window to clock in and out, as well as manage student attendance in the classes they teach.

This app is critical for helping employers and businesses accurately compensate their employees and streamline attendance tracking for educational institutions. Many organizations still rely on in-person clock-in systems, which pose challenges for remote administrative staff.

Why This App Is Important
Employee Productivity: The U.S. economy loses 50 million hours of productivity daily due to unrecorded work. Employers overpay an average of 200 billable hours annually without accurate time tracking.
Attendance Accuracy: Schools and programs often face challenges with maintaining and reviewing attendance records due to reliance on physical records.
Data Insights: Digital records allow easy access to historical data, enabling trend evaluation and informed decision-making.
