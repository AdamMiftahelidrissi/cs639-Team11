## **Proposal**
The app will serve as a **tool for gym employees** to clock in and out of their jobs. Additionally, it will allow instructors to **take attendance for their workout classes** if applicable. 

### **Why This App Matters**
- **Accurate Payroll Tracking**: Helps employers and businesses avoid overpaying or underpaying employees by recording exact work hours.  
  - The US economy loses 50 million hours of productivity per day due to unrecorded work.  
  - Employers overpay an average of 200 billable hours per year without time tracking.  
- **Class Attendance Data**: Provides attendance records for workout classes to help instructors:
  - Track no-shows and implement penalties, such as banning repeat offenders from signing up after missing a set number of classes.
  - Improve accountability and optimize class enrollment.

## **Features**

### **Employee Management**
- **Clock-In/Clock-Out System**: Employees can log their work hours through a simple interface.
- **Employee Profiles**: Stores personal details, roles, and assigned classes.

### **Attendance Management**
- **Class-Specific Attendance**: Instructors can mark attendance for each class session.
- **Historical Attendance Records**: View and export attendance logs for compliance and reporting.

### **Class Scheduling and Management**
- **Class Rosters**: Displays a list of enrolled clients for each class.

### **Reporting and Analytics**
- **Employee Work Hours**: Automatically calculates hours worked for payroll purposes.

### **Administrative Features**
- **User Roles**: Allows admins to manage employees, clients, and class rosters.

### **Mobile-Friendly**
- The app is **optimized for mobile devices**, enabling on-the-go usage by staff.
